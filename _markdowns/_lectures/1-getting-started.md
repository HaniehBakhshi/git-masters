Hi all!

In the first lecture, we talked about VCS, especially Git. We passed the first time setup and configs for Git and started to use it. We learned about file state in Git's "staging" and "working directory."
Each student creates a repository with their username and introduces themselves in the README.md. Then they practice `add`, `commit` and `push` by pushing to the GitHub repository.

A command for add some optional unix tools to the PATH (windows only):

```
prompt>set PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin
```

Configuring Git:

- specify user.name and user.email:

```bash
   $ git config --global user.name "Ali Heydari"
   $ git config --global user.email "Ali4Heydari@gmail.com"
```

- use VS code as default Git editor:

```bash
    $ git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
```
